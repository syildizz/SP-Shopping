# SP_Shopping

SP_Shopping is a project that I have developed during my internship at [_Standard Profil EGE Otomativ San. ve Tic. A.Åž._](https://standardprofil.com).
This internship was a part of my university course "Vocational Training in Workplace". 
My internship lasted for 4 month between the dates 16.09.2024 - 07.01.2025.

I was tasked by my supervisor to create an e-commerce website. 
The goal of the assignment was for me to learn the technologies that were used primarily in the workplace whilst I was developing my project. 

The project is built using the C# language with the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. The project uses the following technologies:

* ASP.NET Core MVC 8
* Bootstrap 5
* EF Core 8
* Identity framework
* Automapper
* ImageSharp
* ImageSharp.Web
* SignalR
* Dynamic LINQ
* FakeItEasy

While working on this project I learned about 
    ASP.NET Core MVC, 
    backend development, 
    layered architecture 
    and SOLID principles.

The mock data used for seeding the database found in the [MOCK_DATA](SP_Shopping/MOCK_DATA) folder was supplied by [mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com). 
The images used for seeding the database in the screenshots were scraped from the website [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/search/fruits).
